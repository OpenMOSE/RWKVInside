# RWKVInside ðŸ§ âš¡

*Because apparently, regular attention mechanisms weren't complicated enough*

## Overview

Welcome to **RWKVInside** â€“ a personal research repository dedicated to the noble art of converting traditional LLM attention mechanisms to RWKV architecture. Because why settle for vanilla attention when you can have something that sounds like a cryptocurrency ticker?

This project represents a deep dive into attention conversion research, featuring the cutting-edge **cxa079** architecture specifically designed for attention transformation models. We've taken RWKV-7 and given it the treatment it truly deserves.

## Features âœ¨

### Core Architecture
- **RWKV-7 Foundation**: Built on the solid bedrock of RWKV-7, because if you're going to reinvent the wheel, might as well use the latest wheel specifications
- **GroupNorm Elimination**: We've courageously removed GroupNorm â€“ one less thing to worry about, right?
- **Key Residual (k_first) Enhancement**: Added Key Residual connections because apparently regular residuals weren't residual enough

### Query & Attention Systems
- **Group Query Style**: Supports both Group Query and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) â€“ because choice is the illusion of freedom
- **Attention Freeze Support**: Sometimes you just want your attention to chill out and stop learning new tricks

### Optimization & Efficiency
- **LoRA Size Optimization**: We've optimized LoRA sizing because size does matter (in parameter efficiency)
- **Bitsandbytes Quantization**: Supporting quantization for those who prefer their models lean and mean
- **LoRA & Bone Compatibility**: Full support for both LoRA and Bone adapters â€“ collect them all!

### Training Capabilities
- **Hybrid Simultaneous Learning**: Train multiple components at once because life's too short for sequential training
- **Advanced Parameter Management**: Fine-grained control over what learns and what doesn't

## Why RWKVInside? ðŸ¤”

In a world saturated with transformer variants, we asked ourselves: "What if attention mechanisms could be... different?" And thus, RWKVInside was born â€“ a testament to the beautiful complexity that emerges when you decide that standard attention just isn't quite attention-y enough.

## Research Notes

This repository serves as a personal research playground for exploring the fascinating world of attention mechanism conversion. The **cxa079** architecture represents our attempt to bridge the gap between traditional transformer attention and RWKV's unique approach.

*Disclaimer: Results may include improved efficiency, reduced memory usage, or an inexplicable urge to convert more attention mechanisms.*

## Contributing

This is a personal research repository, but if you've somehow stumbled upon revolutionary improvements to attention conversion, we're all ears (or should we say, all attention?).
